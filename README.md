# Marco Polo
webVR Marco Polo, originally created for HTC Vive.

One player wears the headset. Up to two other players have controllers. On a signal from the headset player, the players pull the triggers on their controllers to briefly show up on the headset view. The headset wearer attempts to tag the other two players.
